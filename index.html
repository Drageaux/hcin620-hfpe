                <h2>Product</h2>
                <a id="product"></a>
                <p>Electronic election voting systems and ballots are outdated methods for voting in an election. The current system requires all eligible voters to take the time to travel to a remote location, wait in line, and cast their vote. Accessibility is the among the biggest concerns. The website will meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, such as having screen reader support. Usability on the website and app is important, such as having an easy to use user interface. There will be other general accessibility issues addressed also, such as voting 24/7 and a less cumbersome voting process for absentee voters. Young voters are too tech savvy and are put off by the outdated system, and politicians would love to find a new and secure way to reach more voters and get them to vote. That's why online voting in the general and mid-term elections using our secure, simple, and yet modern online voting website and voting app will allow voters to vote anywhere at any time, allow faster vote counts, reach more voters, and more importantly, make it accessible to everyone. The user interface will be sleek and easy to interpret how to securely log-in and cast your vote. The site and app would have customizable settings to make it easier for those with special needs to use the online voting system. We are creating a user experience where the user feels comfortable voting at their convenience in the privacy of their own home or wherever they are around the world.</p>

                <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
                <a id="stakeholders"></a>
                <p>Stakeholders are those people, groups, or individuals who either have the power to affect, or are affected by the endeavour you're engaged with. In our proposed voting system, the regional and national government responsible for development, organization and maintenance of the online voting application can be called the internal stakeholders as they affect the entire process. The proposed system will impact a huge demographic of people with the citizens who are abroad, old people, people with disabilities being some examples. So, the Citizens of the Nation who are influenced by the online voting system will be the external stakeholders. We will adopt stakeholder mapping to understand the ‘level of involvement’ and ‘power of influence’ of the internal parties and mapping of external parties to plan which categories of citizens to approach during the upcoming research phases that focus on empathy and human need.</p>

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <a id="approach"></a>
                <p>In order to create a user interface with high usability, we directly address our stated problem by first researching the voting demographics, especially the young, the disabled, and the remote voters. Through carrying out interviews with a variety of said potential users, we will learn more details of what our product should look like and precisely how it can improve the voting process.</p>

                <p>Based on the results of the interviews, we will conduct usability testing for each prototyping iteration (low- and high- fidelity). By the second iteration, we should already have a couple customizable accessibility features, such as color-blind mode and UI scaling. Our mission is to cater to special needs while keeping the core interactions simple for everyone.</p>
